# BI_birds_classifier

This a project that was develped by Anna Korolyova and Valeriia Ladyhina. The main idea of this project was to develope ML model to distuinguish birds species by photo. For this puposes we took kaggle data set as basis for ML. Additionally to this we developed telegram bot that giving predictions on classification of birds based on images (photos) being sent to it.


Currently telegram bot is not yet located on the server therefore it is has to be fixed in future. Also to try to run telegram bot you can just put your token and start the bot.
